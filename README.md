Average Joes 3620 Pit design.
This was the summer project for the team prior to the 2024 Crescendo season. 

We spend a bit of time inspecting and cataloging other team's pits in the '22 and '23 seasons and decided that we wanted to up our pit game for this year. Originally desgined for welded steel tube, we received a generous donation from Eagle Technologies in St. Joseph for a large array of 1515, 1530 and 3030 T slot extrusion. So a re-design and here we are. We also received a generous donation from Coulson Casters for the pit casters. 6" under the carts and 8" for the robot cart.

Basic design goals (determining this was part of the process of the design):
1) 4 carts to load / unload from trailer (A, B, Robot, Marketing carts)
2) A Cart:
   * The cart we would roll to finals for competitions.
   * 24" deep
   * 68" tall collapsed.
   * Integrated battery charger (bottom left side)
   * Tool drawers (bottom right side)
   * Monitors and computer for qual match schedule and streaming matches in pits (facing aisle on end)
   * About 1300 lbs loaded
4) B Cart:
   * Stays in pits for finals
   * 68" tall packed
   * "Heavy Repair" cart - drill press, band saw, sander, large spares, etc.
   * "Deeper" spares - stuff we won't need for finals repairs, if we do, we have bigger problems.
   * 30" deep = more room for a workspace and top
   * Overhead lights over the robot when in pits (this is a game changer for us)
   * About 1100 lbs loaded.
6) Robot Cart = cable actuated elevator for working under the robot. Lowered for transport
7) Marketing Cart = buttons, TV for presentations, Judge's book, etc. Also one of the corners for the overhead banners
8) Actuators are ~1,000 N 12vdc units off Amazon 18" stroke
9) The gas shocks are 36" 100 lb units off Amazon.
10) Linear slides are "SBR12" sized units, again amazon.
11) There are a whole bunch of quality of life small things we added.
    * Coat hooks on the end in the corner - Michigan after all.
    * Fans on the B cart so the pit crew stays cool when turning the robot for the next match.
    * Lots and lots of lighting.
    * Slim mini computer for match schedule display (a rasp pi would work too)
    * Lots and lots of organization for tools.
