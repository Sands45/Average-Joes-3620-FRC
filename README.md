**Average Joes 3620 Pit design.**
This was the summer project for the team prior to the 2024 Crescendo season. 

We spend a bit of time inspecting and cataloging other team's pits in the '22 and '23 seasons and decided that we wanted to up our pit game for this year. Originally designed for welded steel tube, we received a generous donation from Eagle Technologies in St. Joseph for a large array of 1515, 1530 and 3030 T slot extrusion. The Saint Joseph Public Schools Foundation for a donation of tools. We also received a generous donation from Coulson Casters for the pit casters. 6" under the carts and 8" for the robot cart. 

So a re-design from steel to AL and here we are.

**Basic design goals (determining this was part of the process of the design):**
1) 4 carts to load / unload from trailer (A, B, Robot, Marketing cart)
2) 6 kids and sub 10 minute setup. (two kids for the A and B cart to safely push them).
3) All 4 elements will fit into our trailer with some room to spare. So a faster load/unload if it's not super tight. 
4) Lights, lots of lights, especially over the robot.
5) Outlets, lots of outlets.
6) EVERTYHING has a home on the carts. For transport and for game time. Chest drawers are lined with foam tiles and then cutout so tools have a home and don't roll around during transport.
7) Computer display for match schedule (vs white board).
8) Computer display for streaming matches or marketing presentations.
9) Enough tools (with drawer storage) for 3 people to work on the robot at once.
10) We build the robot out of the Pit carts (so we know where all the tools are and are used to working in that space).
11) Actuators are ~1,500 N 12vdc units off Amazon 18" stroke. 12vdc power supply in the cart for primary power. Backup power is off a robot battery.
12) The gas shocks are 36" 100 lb units off Amazon. The upper weighs about 250lbs unloaded. If an actuator failed, we'd unload the upper, manually raise, then prop up.
13) Linear slides are "SBR12" sized units, again Amazon. SBR12 rails are about 1.5" wide, so convenient when bolting them up to the 1.5" AL extrusions.
14) There are a whole bunch of quality of life things we added:
    * Coat hooks on the end in the corner - Michigan after all.
    * Fans on the B cart so the pit crew stays cool when turning the robot for the next match.
    * Lots and lots of lighting.
    * Slim mini computer for match schedule display (a rasp pi would work too). Eventually we may do a stop motion or live displays from the pits. 
    * Lots and lots of organization for tools.
    * Polycarb "doors" (the things with the X's on them) to retain stuff in the cart for transport. Fast and easy to install / remove.
    * Eye bolts in key locations to retain parts, drawers, lights, etc. We used shipping straps for this. 
   
**A Cart:**
   * The cart we would roll to finals for competitions.
   * 24" deep
   * 68" tall collapsed.
   * Nine battery rack and charger (bottom left side, not resolved in CAD. We re-used existing shelves for the batteries).
   * Tool drawers (bottom right side. Gladiator garage drawer unit donated).
   * Monitors and computer for qualifier match schedule and streaming matches in pits (facing aisle on end).
   * About 1300 lbs loaded - 9 batteries are heavy!
     
 **B Cart:**
   * Stays in pits for finals
   * 68" tall packed
   * 30" deep = more room for a workspace and top
   * "Heavy Repair" cart - drill press, band saw, sander, large spares, etc.
   * "Deeper" spares - 3 tote bins and stuff we won't need for finals repairs, if we do, we have bigger problems.
   * Overhead lights over the robot when in pits (this is a game changer for us)
   * About 1100 lbs loaded.
     
 **Robot Cart:**
  * Cable actuated elevator for working under the robot. Lowered for transport (~$60 winch from Harbor Freight)
  * Forks are width adjustable for each year's robot.
  * Larger diameter casters for easier rolling over door threasholds and the pit floor at Saginaw State's Field House gym
  * Side panel LEDs (not in CAD) for showing off sponsor logos, etc.
  * Large enough cabinet for travel storage for controllers, robot laptop, etc.
  
 **Marketing Cart:** (Sorry, CAD isn't fully up to date... )
   * Buttons, TV for presentations, Judge's book, etc.
   * Supports one of the corners for the overhead banners
   * "Dump Bin" in the bottom for all the buttons, binders, etc.
   * Mount a TV on the corner post, so a power strip below with a ~15' extension cord.

 **Next Steps?**
 1) Not quite sure, but there are some small "quality of life" tweeks for use-ability and speed of setup that we want to do. (eg., a vacuum attachement for the bad saw, a better place for shipping straps, etc. etc.)
 2) Need a place for the robot laptops for setup and transport
 3) Discussing a 5th cart that would be in the back left corner. A rack for backpacks and a stand for a larger TV for match streams. Jokingly, also a beverage dispenser.
