Average Joes 3620 Pit design.
This was the summer project for the team prior to the 2024 Crescendo season. 

We spend a bit of time inspecting and cataloging other team's pits in the '22 and '23 seasons and decided that we wanted to up our pit game for this year. Originally desgined for welded steel tube, we received a generous donation from Eagle Technologies in St. Joseph for a large array of 1515, 1530 and 3030 T slot extrusion. So a re-design and here we are. We also received a generous donation from Coulson Casters for the pit casters. 6" under the carts and 8" for the robot cart.

Basic design goals (determining this was part of the process of the design):
1) 4 carts to load / unload from trailer (A, B, Robot, Marketing carts)
2) A Cart:
   The cart we would roll to finals for competitions.
   24" deep
   68" tall collapsed.
   Integrated battery charger
   Tool drawers
   Monitors and computer for qual match schedule and streaming matches in pits
   About 1300 lbs loaded
4) B Cart:
   Stays in pits for finals
   68" tall packed
   "Heavy Repair" cart - drill press, band saw, sander, large spares, etc.
   Deaper spares - stuff we won't need for finals repairs, if we do, we have bigger problems.
   30" deep = more room for a workspace and top
   Overhead lights over the robot when in pits (this is a game changer for us)
   About 1100 lbs loaded.
6) Robot Cart = cable actuated elevator for working under the robot. Lowered for transport
7) Marketing Cart = buttons, TV for presentations, Judge's book, etc. Also one of the corners for the overhead banners
8)
